## Welcome to List of OPENSource API's

We are trying to list down as many as possible free and open source API's available for developers which are either free to use with or without API keys. 















### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Klupti/PublicFreeAPIs/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
